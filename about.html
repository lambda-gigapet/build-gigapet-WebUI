						Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for
						light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my
						fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One
						more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around!
						I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of

						Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side.
						Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join
						you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
						consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
						No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
						You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and
						defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will
						I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
