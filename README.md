# Gigapet Web UI portion - Available on Netlify

The following is a description of work done by Jeremy Brady at Lambda School during their Unit 1 Build Week.

## What did we build as a team?
We created a full application capable of taking inputs from parents to feed to a fictional avatar that would reflect it's growth and show the child the benefits of eating well.

## What was my role?
- [ ]  Built a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
- [ ] Marketing website includes responsive mobile and desktop screen widths.
- [ ]  The call to action on the website links the user over to the React application that the Front End Architect is built.
- [ ]  The marketing website is hosted on a hosting platform "Netlify".
- [ ]  Created copy and content related to the rest of the project.
- [ ]  Included descriptions about the product and about the features it provides. 
- [ ]  About us including the team and their Github repositories.
